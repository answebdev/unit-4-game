# unit-4-game

Crystal Collector is a game that begins with a random number. The user tries to match the random number by clicking consecutively on the four different crystals, each with its own random value set at the start of play. The user wins by matching his or her score to the random number. If the user goes over the random number, he or she loses. The game continues and the wins and losses are added together so that the user can see how many wins and losses have been accumulated.

This project uses jQuery and JavaScript, as well as HTML and CSS, including Bootstrap. The icons used come from Font Awesome. The favicon used on the tab is also from Font Awesome. Flash messages have been added to the "Crystal Collector" div in the bottom right hand corner. If the user wins, a win message flashes. If the user loses, a message flashes informing the user that he or she has lost.
